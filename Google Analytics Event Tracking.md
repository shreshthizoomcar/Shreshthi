Event Tracking works through passing the following information to Google Analytics:
Category, Action, Label and Value. 

Also, you don’t need to include a tag saying which page the Event happened on, as this is captured through the standard trackPageview functionality. 

'<a href=”/downloads/whitepapers/seo-is-great.pdf” onClick=”_gaq.push([‘_trackEvent’, ‘whitepaper’, ‘download’, ‘SEO is great’, 5, true]);” target=”_blank”>SEO Is Great Whitepaper</a>'
